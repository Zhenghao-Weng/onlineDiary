    "text": "4.1 Summary\nThere are four types of correction in RS.\n\nGeometric Correction: This involves the correction of the geometric shape of the image to ensure its accuracy.\nAtmospheric Correction: This adjusts the image to eliminate the impact of the atmosphere on the observed data.\nOrthorectification/Terrain Correction: This corrects the image distortion caused by terrain.\nRadiometric Correction: This adjusts the image data to reflect the true surface radiation values.\n\n\n4.1.1 Dark Object Subtraction\nIn the practical session this week Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) is introduced. DOS is a relatively simple atmospheric correction method used to remove the effects of the atmosphere from satellite imagery, thereby improving the accuracy of the data. The DOS method is based on the logic that the darkest pixel in the satellite image should have zero reflectance; therefore, any value detected can be attributed to the atmospheric effect. By subtracting this value from the rest of the pixels in the image, the impact of the atmosphere can be minimized.\n\nSelecting the Darkest Pixel: First, the darkest pixel in the satellite image needs to be identified. This pixel is assumed to have the minimum reflectance, typically close to zero, but due to atmospheric scattering and other effects, it actually has a non-zero value.\nCalculating Atmospheric Influence: After identifying the darkest pixel, its value (Digital Number, DN) is considered to be caused by atmospheric effects. This value represents the degree of atmospheric influence on the entire image.\nApplying the DOS Formula: Next, the value of the darkest pixel is subtracted from the values of all other pixels in the image. This step aims to remove the atmospheric increment from the measurement value of each pixel, thereby approximating the true surface reflectance.\nConverting to Reflectance: After subtracting the atmospheric influence, the corrected DN values need to be converted to reflectance. This usually involves using satellite-specific conversion formulas that take into account the position of the sun, the distance between the Earth and the sun, and other relevant parameters.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Image Enhancements\nSeveral techniques for enhancing satellite imagery are covered, including ratioing (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI), filtering, and texture analysis. These methods help emphasize or exaggerate certain features or spectral traits in the imagery.\n\n\n4.1.3 Data Fusion and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nThe page touches on the concept of data fusion, combining different raster datasets to enrich the analysis. It also introduces PCA as a method to reduce the dimensionality of data, making it easier to analyze and interpret."

Two sets of images were used: raw images and DOS-corrected images, along with several water indices to analyze and compare their performance in wetland mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The NDWI produced from the raw imagery\n(b) Classified NDWI using the optimal threshold\n(c) The NDWI produced from the DOS imagery\n(d) Classified DOS NDWI using the optimal threshold\n(e) The MNDWI produced from the raw imagery\n(f) Classified MNDWI using the optimal threshold\n(g) The MNDWI produced from the DOS imagery\n(h) Classified DOS MNDWI using the optimal threshold\nThe results show that DOS-corrected images, compared to raw images, exhibit improvements across various accuracy metrics such as overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, and Kappa coefficient. Notably, the MNDWI index demonstrates superior performance on DOS-corrected imagery, achieving an overall accuracy of 98% and a Kappa coefficient exceeding 0.9, indicating that DOS correction significantly enhances the ability to recognize the boundaries between wetland and non-wetland areas. Furthermore, the study found that DOS-corrected images could produce a sharper contrast between wetland and non-wetland areas compared to raw images."

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nThe DOS method operates by identifying and subtracting the reflectance values of “dark objects” within an image, which are assumed to have minimal or no reflectance and are primarily affected by atmospheric scattering. These dark objects typically include deep water bodies, cloud shadows, or any other feature with very low reflectance. By subtracting this atmospheric contribution, the DOS method aims to bring the imagery closer to true surface reflectance values, thereby improving the interpretability and accuracy of the data. Researches have verified that DOS has the following advantages:\n\nImproved Accuracy: DOS-corrected imagery shows a marked improvement in distinguishing wetland areas, with significant enhancements in overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, and Kappa coefficient metrics compared to uncorrected raw images.\nEfficiency: DOS is recognized for its simplicity and efficiency, requiring fewer inputs and less complex processing than more robust atmospheric correction methods, such as the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH). This makes DOS particularly useful in areas where detailed atmospheric data are unavailable.\nFlexibility in Dark Target Selection: Research indicates that non-ideal dark targets, such as cloud-shadow pixels or the minimum reflectance value within an image, can effectively serve as alternatives to the ideal dark target of optically-deep water. This flexibility ensures the method’s applicability across diverse landscapes where ideal dark objects may not be present."

    "title": "5  Indonesia’s giant capital city is sinking-A case study of Jakarta’s flooding solution",
    "section": "5.1 Summary",
    "text": "5.1 Summary\nJakarta is the cultural, political and economical heart of Indonesia. This huge cosmopolitan city is with 28 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area, one of the most densely populated cities of South East Asia. However, the Jakarta floods in early 2021 shows how the city’s drainage network can no longer accommodate rainfall, resulting in floods in various locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from drainage issues, there are three key contributing factors to Jakarta’s flooding:\n\nExtreme rainfall: Highly intense and short extreme rainfall is becoming more frequent. Extreme rainfall is a direct result of the climate crisis.\nChanges in land cover: Land cover data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) for 2000 and 2019 show growing plantation forests by up to 117.7 percent upstream of the river that flows into Jakarta, replacing agricultural lands. Settlement areas have also grown rapidly by 47.4 percent, replacing agricultural lands and green open spaces in central and downstream areas. Green open space only made up 9.8 percent of Jakarta’s area by 2019. This has increased the risk of overflowing rivers and drainage networks due to high volume of runoff, water, not to mention the threat of sedimentation in rivers due to high erosion rates in upstream areas.\nLand subsidence: Land subsidence in Jakarta averages at 12 cm/year. It is even more extreme in the northern coast with a subsidence rate of up to 25cm/year. According to Takagi et al. (2015), subsidence-related flooding will expand by 100.5 km2 by 2050, covering 75 percent of North Jakarta. Building loads and excess groundwater extraction have further accelerated land subsidence. Currently, around 35% of Jakarta residents still use groundwater for their daily needs. As a result, Jakarta’s groundwater level and water storage capacity have continued to decline.\n\n\n5.1.1 Metropolitan Policy\nPetaJakarta.org is a research project led by the SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong in collaboration with the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) and Twitter Inc. The project enabled Jakarta’s citizens to report the locations of flood events using the social media network Twitter, thereby contributing to a publicly accessible real-time map of flood conditions at PetaJakarta.org. These data were used by BPBD DKI Jakarta to cross-validate formal reports of flooding from traditional data sources, supporting the creation of information for flood assessment, response, and management in real-time.\n\n\n5.1.2 National Policy\nIndonesia’s 2007 Spatial Planning Act is essential to increasing water capacity by requiring all urban areas to set aside 30% of the city land for green space, such as city parks, cemeteries, and green roads. In Jakarta, currently only 10% of the city is green open space, accordingto an analysis by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), suggesting a lack ofenforcement for national spatial planning laws at the city level. Jakarta’s most substantial infrastructure response to climate change is the $40 billion National Capital IntegratedCoastal Development (NCICD), which includes the development of a water reservoir, reclamation of land, andconstruction of a seawall along the coast (The Giant Swa Wall of Jakarta), designed to protect the mainland fromtidal flooding.However, the seawall’s projected completion date has been delayed due to stalled negotiations, as the DKI administration is still negotiating with the national Public Works and Public Housing Ministry about which projects will be led by which government bodies (Rahadryan, 2019).\n\n\n5.1.3 International Policy\nOn December 19, 2022, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved a US$400 million loan to support the Government of Indonesia in protecting an estimated 6.3 million people in cities across Indonesia from damage caused by flooding and in bolstering national flood resilience management. The National Urban Flood Resilience Project (NUFReP) will help cities reduce the flood risk by increasing national and city-level flood risk management capacity and through investments for integrated urban flood risk management. It will also support the government in establishing and operationalizing a national urban flood resilience program. The national urban flood resilience program supported by NUFReP will offer a menu of measures to help cities with different flood and climate risks in an integrated manner. This program will serve as a national umbrella program to help coordinate sources of financing and function as a knowledge hub to help Indonesian cities leverage good practices and continuously advance sector policy, practice, and innovation."

    "text": "5.2 Application\nSome researches have already verified that RS techniques can be significantly useful in mapping the flood-affected areas, calculating the dimensions of the flooded area and providing critical information for future disaster preparedness (Mutiara, 2019; Dinuke, 2018). Data from Landsat-8 are utilized which providing multispectral images with eight bands at a spatial resolution of 30 meters, a panchromatic band at 15 meters, and two thermal bands at 100 meters. In Indonesia, there is a government agency which is formed for organizing and providingremote sensing data. The Deputy of Remote Sensing Department of National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, Indonesia (LAPAN) has already obtained an authority to provide Landsat data.\nThe integration of Landsat satellite data can positively impact Jakarta’s policy and Indonesia’s policy.\n\n5.2.1 Impact on PetaJakarta.org\n\nData Verification and Supplement: Landsat satellite data can independently verify flood conditions reported by users on Twitter. By comparing the flood extent in satellite imagery with community reports, the actual situation of the flood, including its spread and severity, can be understood more accurately.\nEnhanced Flood Monitoring Capability: Combining community reports with Landsat data can create a more comprehensive flood monitoring system. Landsat’s broad view and high spatiotemporal resolution imagery can capture flood events that Twitter reports might miss, making flood monitoring more comprehensive and timely.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Impact on NCICD\n\nPlanning and Optimization of Embankment Location: Landsat data can provide detailed terrain and land cover information of river basins, helping decision-makers more accurately plan the location and design of embankments. By analyzing changes in the land surface before and after floods, areas frequently affected by flooding can be identified, guiding the optimal layout of embankments.\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment: Before the construction of embankments, Landsat satellite data can be used to assess the potential environmental impact of the plan. By monitoring changes in vegetation cover, hydrological conditions, and surface temperature of the construction area, the project’s impact on ecosystems can be predicted, providing a basis for formulating mitigation measures.\nProject Supervision and Effectiveness Evaluation: After the construction of embankments, Landsat data can be used to monitor the long-term effects and maintenance status of the project. By regularly comparing satellite images of the flood control area, the effectiveness of the embankments in flood prevention and potential issues can be assessed, providing information support for subsequent improvements."

    "text": "5.3 Reflection\nFrom the aforementioned case analysis, policies addressing urban issues are usually comprised of different levels. International policies tend to be comprehensive and broad, outlining general development directions or involving resource assistance from developed countries to others. Thus, international policies focus on the determination of overall directions and the allocation of resources. National policies typically further analyze problems within a country and propose a feasible plan. However, these plans usually take a long time to complete but have significant effectiveness in solving problems. Therefore, national policies focus on long-term effects. Urban policies often complement national policies, achieving some effects with smaller investments, but many times they cannot fundamentally solve problems. Hence, urban policies focus on short-term effects. In the aforementioned case, the application of RS data can enhance the effectiveness of urban policies, providing validation and supplement for PetaJakarta.org. It can also optimize solutions within national policies, improving the construction locations of embankments; at the same time, it minimizes losses before the completion of national policies by predicting and assessing disasters for floods occurring during riverside construction. The success of national policy plans can also be promoted to other countries through international policies as a model. Other countries affected by flooding can gain experience from Jakarta’s case in RS data application, the public online flood reporting community, and embankment construction projects, fostering global collective development."

Two main approaches are discussed:\n\nDefining end members directly through known values or selecting points on the image that represent pure land cover types.\nUsing training data to average the spectral signatures of land cover types and create end members.\n\nThe unmix() function in GEE is then used to apply spectral unmixing to the image, producing a new image that represents the fractional composition of each land cover type within the pixels.\n\n\n8.1.2 Accuracy Assessment for Sub-pixel Analysis:\nThe webpage acknowledges the challenge of assessing accuracy in sub-pixel analysis due to the continuous nature of the output (fractions of land cover types). Two main approaches to address this challenge are mentioned:\n\nHardening the sub-pixel image by classifying each pixel based on the dominant land cover fraction (e.g., assigning a pixel to a land cover class if more than 50% of the pixel is composed of that class).\nA more involved method that requires overlaying high-resolution imagery over Landsat pixels, digitizing high-resolution data within each pixel, and comparing the results.\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA):\nImage Gradient and Spectral Gradient: Initial steps in OBIA involve identifying changes in intensity or color in an image to group pixels into objects.\nSuper Pixels and Clustering: Techniques like k-means clustering and Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) are introduced to segment the image into super pixels or objects based on spectral and spatial similarities.\n\nK-means clustering groups pixels into clusters with similar spectral properties.\nSNIC performs clustering without iterative processes, considering both color and spatial proximity to create more defined objects.\n\nThe output of these clustering methods can then be used to extract additional information, such as standard deviation or NDVI for each object, which can assist in further classification or analysis.\n\n\n8.1.4 Classification of Objects:\nIt involves selecting training data (points or polygons) representing different land cover types, extracting features from the objects, and then training a classifier (e.g., CART) using this training data. The classified image is then visualized in GEE, showing the distribution of land cover types across the study area."

The study compares a single split of data into training and test sets against a resampling framework where classification and accuracy assessment are repeated multiple times.

The accuracy and efficiency of remote sensing classification have significantly improved by utilizing advanced algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning. These algorithms are capable of processing and analyzing large-scale remote sensing data, extracting complex surface features, and thereby achieving more accurate identification of land cover types and monitoring changes.\nLooking forward, the future development of integrating classification algorithms with remote sensing will likely focus on further methodological innovations, particularly in improving accuracy assessment techniques. The trend is towards more dynamic, spatially-aware models that can better account for the complexity and variability of the earth’s surface as captured by remote sensing technologies. As machine learning and deep learning algorithms continue to evolve, we can anticipate more sophisticated approaches for modeling and evaluating the accuracy of remote sensing classifications. This will likely involve integrating multi-source data, enhancing the resolution and quality of remote sensing inputs, and leveraging big data and cloud computing platforms for more efficient data processing and analysis. Together, these advancements will provide stronger support for global environmental monitoring efforts, contributing significantly to our understanding and management of natural and human-modified landscapes."

First, they employ the Canny edge detector combined with the Otsu automatic thresholding algorithm on time-series Sentinel-2 images to delineate field edges accurately. This step is crucial for minimizing classification errors caused by mixed pixels at the boundaries of cropland parcels. Second, they apply the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to classify crops based on phenological information extracted from time-series images of both Landsat and Sentinel-2. The RF model, configured with 500 trees, utilizes the yearly time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) as input variables. This phenology-based approach allows for the differentiation of crop types across the study area, taking advantage of the distinct seasonal growth patterns of different crops."

The temperature band (B10) in Landsat, which is in Kelvin, is adjusted to Celsius. The process includes filtering the data by date, cloud cover, and applying scale factors to the thermal bands. A mean temperature image is then created and visualized with a specific color palette.\n\n\n9.1.3 MODIS Data:\nThe MODIS instrument, aboard both the Terra and Aqua satellites, provides more frequent global coverage. The practical explores using MODIS data for the same period and area as the Landsat data, highlighting the differences in image resolution and the number of images available. The MODIS data also undergoes scaling adjustments to convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius.\n\n\n9.1.4 Temperature Visualization:\nBoth Landsat and MODIS processed data are visualized to display urban temperatures. The visualization parameters include a color palette that ranges from cool to warm temperatures.\n\n\n9.1.5 Time Series Analysis:\nCreate a time series chart of temperature using MODIS data, which allows for the observation of temperature changes over time, albeit with a loss of spatial detail.\n\n\n9.1.6 Spatial Unit Statistics:\nExplore calculated average temperatures for smaller administrative units within Beijing using the reduceRegions function in GEE. This method enables the examination of temperature variations across different areas.\n\n\n9.1.7 Export and Trend Analysis\nExport the processed data for further analysis outside of GEE.

In Ermida’s research, the methodology is based on GEE’s cloud computing capabilities (Ermida, et al., 2020). By providing a code repository for computing Landsat LST within GEE, the methodology significantly reduces the barriers to accessing and utilizing high-resolution LST data for environmental analysis. In another research by pedreros, they utilize GEE to access to and preprocessing of Landsat 7 and 8 satellite imagery covering the study period, including cloud cover removal and quality assessment and implement six methods for LSWT retrieval within the GEE environment, which could be a critical challenge without such cloud service."

RS is defined as the science of obtaining information about an object or area from a distance, typically from instruments on satellites or aircraft.\n\n2.1.1 Active & Passive Sensors\n\nPassive Sensors: Depend on sunlight reflected from the Earth’s surface. Their effectiveness can be hindered by clouds or atmospheric conditions.\nActive Sensors: Emit their own signals to the Earth and measure the reflection, allowing them to operate in darkness and penetrate cloud cover.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 The Electromagnetic Spectrum\nThe electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all types of electromagnetic radiation, ranging from gamma rays, which have very short wavelengths, to radio waves, which have very long wavelengths. The spectrum is divided into regions based on wavelength or frequency, including ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwave, and radio waves.\nIdentification and analysis of Earth’s surface materials and phenomena can be done through the detection of reflected electromagnetic radiation across different parts of the spectrum.\n\n\n2.1.3 Resolutions of Remote Sensing Data\nRemote sensing data is characterized by four types of resolution:\n\nSpectral Resolution: The number and range of spectral bands captured by the sensor.\nSpatial Resolution: The size of the smallest object that can be resolved, usually described by the size of the sensor’s pixels.\nTemporal Resolution: How often the sensor acquires data of the same area.\nRadiometric Resolution: The sensor’s ability to distinguish between different levels of radiance."

RS technology not only locates soil degradation problems but also distinguishes different forms of soil degradation: soil erosion, soil salinization, soil desertification, and soil heavy metal pollution. Among them, I am impressed by soil heavy metal pollution, which directly identifies the components of heavy metal pollution in the soil through the different spectral reflectance rates of different metals.\n\nThis application aligns well with the principles of RS technology itself and provides an innovative solution to locate soil heavy metal pollution without the need for actual sample analysis. This solution offers significant advantages in terms of time, cost, and the health of researchers when locating large-scale pollution problems."
